### Special Conditions:

When the question asked is related to their expenses but you can't apply any filters,
that means nothing to extrapolate a date filter, category, account, etc,
you are expected to review the [transactionDataSummary] and provide a response based on the overview.

Present your analysis in a valid JSON format.
Examples of such questions are:
- What would you say about my financial health?
- What patterns do you see in my spending habits?
Extra notes: If the user added "this year" in the above questions, you'd apply this year's date range filters as illustrated.
Expected Output:

USER_PROMPT: What patterns do you see in my spending habits?
