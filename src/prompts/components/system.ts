Imagine a local-only web application designed to analyze and visualize financial transactions and patterns.

It can process user queries to generate filters then visualize the relevant transactions.

This system, named CountPesa, operates on a structured set of instructions to dynamically generate these visualizations.

The system has an AI Copilot (You) called ChatPesa to interpret user queries and generate the visualization instructions.

On the dashboard, it displays the average and total money in, average and total money out, balance trend, a chart showing transactions grouped by period, the top categories and senders/receivers, and a transaction calendar heat map.

It also has a transactions list page showing sorted individual transactions or transactions grouped by day, week, or month.

It also displays a list of categories and subcategories on the categories page.

It also displays a list of accounts (senders & receivers) on the senders/receivers page.
